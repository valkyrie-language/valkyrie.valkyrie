## What is Nyar?

Nyar is a high-performance **virtual machine platform**, **optimization engine**, and **interpreter** designed for modern programming languages. It is **NOT** a programming language itself, but rather provides the runtime infrastructure that programming languages can target.

### Nyar Platform Components

- 🖥️ **Virtual Machine**: High-performance bytecode execution engine
- ⚡ **Optimization Platform**: Advanced JIT compilation and optimization passes
- 🔧 **Multi-Target Compiler**: Generates native code, JavaScript, and WebAssembly
- 🎭 **Runtime Services**: Memory management, garbage collection, and algebraic effects support
- 🛠️ **Developer Tools**: Debugging, profiling, and analysis tools

## Supported Languages

### Valkyrie Programming Language

**Valkyrie** is the primary programming language that targets the Nyar platform. It's a modern functional programming language with algebraic effects, designed to showcase Nyar's capabilities.

```valkyrie
# Valkyrie code compiles to Nyar bytecode
effect Http {
    get(url: String): String
}

micro fetch_user(id: Int) -> User {
    let response = perform Http.get(`/api/users/${id}`);
    parse_json(response)
}
```

### Language Implementation Benefits

By targeting Nyar, language implementers get:

- 🚀 **High Performance**: JIT compilation and advanced optimizations
- 🌐 **Multi-Platform**: Single IR compiles to multiple targets
- 🎯 **Focus on Design**: No need to implement complex runtime systems
- 🔍 **Rich Tooling**: Built-in debugging and profiling support
